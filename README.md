# Enable macOS HiDPI

## Explanation

[English](README.md)

ï£¿ This script can simulate macOS HiDPI on a non-retina display, and have a "Native" Scaled in System Preferences.

Some device have wake-up issue, script's second option may help, it inject a patched EDID, but another problem may exists here.

Logo scaling up may not be resolved, cuz the higher resolution is faked.

## Recovery

If you cant boot into system, or get any another issues, you can use clover `-x ` reboot or into Recovery mode, remove your display's DisplayVendorID folder under `/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` , and move backup files

In Terminal: 

```
$ cd /Volumes/"Your System Disk Part"/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
$ VendorID=$(ioreg -l | grep "DisplayVendorID" | awk '{print $8}')
$ Vid=$(echo "obase=16;$VendorID" | bc | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
$ rm -rf ./DisplayVendorID-$Vid
$ cp -r ./backup/* ./
```
